# ðŸšš Go Delivery Cost Calculator API

This is a backend REST API built with **Go** and **Fiber** that calculates the **minimum delivery cost** of transporting a set of products from multiple distribution centers (`C1`, `C2`, `C3`) to a common destination (`L1`). It considers product weights, inter-location distances, and delivery cost brackets.
